\noindent
The explosive growth in the discovery and characterization of CRISPR-associated (\emph{cas}) genes has outstripped their systematic re-classification. These genes have thus been renamed, sometimes more than once. For example, metagenomic sequencing databases often retain an archaic name, confounding bioinformatic and literature searches. Here, we provide a translation between current and archaic names of \emph{cas} genes. In cases where there is no consensus in the community, we prefer the most consistent naming scheme. In addition, this work describes an online repository for future re-classification of \emph{cas} genes. This work will help to unify the CRISPR community around a common set of gene names, and provide a reference to refer to prior literature.
